# Olivia App react native

- One screen for Log in
- Not really a log in feature yet
- GET request to Rails API to the user in the database
- Checking on the front end if the response username and password matches to the inputted username and password
- This only works because there is 1 entry in the database

Next step

- Change to POST request and do the checking on the back end
